# ASKfm-Terminal-Project

The goal of this project is to apply what i have learnt from **Starting Out with C++ - Tony Gaddis** book starting from chapter 1 to chapter 12.

## Main Features: 
1. Applying File System for **Storing** and **Retrieving** data from text files.
2. Signup / Login menus.
3. Ask , Answer & Delete questions.
4. Navigate easily through menus and superloop. 

> An Important Note: The version that is working properly is **[V.1.6](https://github.com/MonerMo/ASKfm-Terminal-Project/tree/V.1.6)** , I know that the 
code is not well documented and have a lot of comments because I was making this project in a rush at the end of Ramadan :hearts: .

I will attach a photo for an A4 paper :page_facing_up: that I used to graph the hierarchy and the return signals inside the project. Also , I will add a
link to a video where I am using the program :film_strip: .
